Hello I am Emilia Dimitriou.
This is my first time sharing with github, I thought it'd be good practice.

This is my attempt to make a sudoku board solver in Python.
Inputing boards is a bit of a pain but I just want it to work.

UPDATE 19/07/2024

I'm done with this project for now, there are a few interesting ideas here if you are a beginner.
Doesn't work well enough for me to be super happy with it, I think I will come back in the future with a second version but done with it for now.
